    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is popular!\n",
    "\n",
    "Matlab used to be one of the mainstream languages, but now Python has taken over that role for data science and computer science\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring its popularity is in itself a data science problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sources for data that helps us measure Python's popularity\n",
    "- [TIOBE](https://tiobe.com/tiobe-index/): Based on google search results\n",
    "    - depends on how many people are searching for this platform; how many people are looking up Python on google search engine\n",
    "- [PYPL PopularitY](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html): Based on google trends\n",
    "    - based on ranking; how much online courses and youtube tutorials that are being looked up\n",
    "    - focuses on beginners and what programs ppl are more likely to get started with (mostly Python)\n",
    "- [GitHut 2.0](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/2): Based on Github\n",
    "    - Based on what kind of programs people are using and uploading on Github, which is a platform that allows people to share their codes and collaborate and work on them\n",
    "    - towards more experienced users (JavaScript seems to be the most popular, Python comes at a 2nd place)\n",
    "    - MatLab (almost 0%), used by community of mathematicians and the platform is often expensive\n",
    "- [Redmonk](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/07/27/language-rankings-6-20/): Based on Github+Stack Overflow\n",
    "    - compares popularity rank on Github with Stack Overflow\n",
    "    - Stack Overflow is a website to ask about programming languages\n",
    "    - scatterplot; shows a visual picture of the most popular languages in both platforms\n",
    "- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2020): conducted a survey asking data scientists\n",
    "    - data includes the data scientists' gender, age, ethnicity, education, etc.\n",
    "    - mostly male, 23-29 age gap is most popular, master's degree, taking online courses, experience, pay rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is good!\n",

    "Stable learning curve\n",

    "    - Interpreted: we write something and we get an outcome (similar to Matlab where you'd write an equation and get an outcome)\n",
    "        - easier to do interactive\n",
    "    - Compiled: you finish other programming and compare it, then run it as a whole (C, C++, etc.)\n",
