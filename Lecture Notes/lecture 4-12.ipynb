    "\n",
    "In Matlab, the arguments are usually **passed by value** in the functions. However, Python functions **pass the arguments by object reference**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, below we do not discuss the global variables here (As the famous saying goes, *global variables are evil in object-oriented languages*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, suppose we have an object named ``obj_python`` that is passed to a function ``func(obj_func)``. What does the function do is create a new name (identifier) by ``obj_func = obj_python`` that points to the **same object** (instead of creating a new object!). All the statements within function are then executed with the name (identifier) ``obj_fun``, and the name ``obj_fun`` will be destroyed after calling the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For *mutable objects*, the modification with ``obj_fun`` inside the function may change the value of object, which is pointed by the name ``obj_python`` outside the function. \n",
    "- For *immutable objects*, since the value cannot be modified once the object is created, the function will not affect the object pointed by ``obj_python``.\n",
    "- That's why some people say in Python, the immutable objects are passed by values, while the mutable objects are passed by reference or pointer -- they are indeed the ''net effects''. In fact, these observations are the reflections of **passing by object reference** mechanism in Python."
